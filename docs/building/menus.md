A menu represents a type of response ONEm sends back to the user and it allows the user to select certain options you put in the menu.

It is composed by a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The body can contain **option** or **content** items.

When an option is being accessed, ONEm platform will perform an HTTP request to the callback path you set.

## Json Structure

Your server must return a JSON response with a structure similar to the one below:

```
{'body': [{'description': 'New todo',
           'method': 'GET',
           'path': '/task/create/',
           'type': 'option'},
          {'description': 'Done(0)',
           'method': 'GET',
           'path': '/task/list/done/',
           'type': 'option'},
          {'description': 'Todo(1)',
           'method': None,
           'path': None,
           'type': 'content'},
          {'description': 'buy coffee 2019-07-01',
           'method': 'GET',
           'path': '/task/7/',
           'type': 'option'}],
 'footer': None,
 'header': 'home',
 'type': 'menu'}
```

Notice the **'type': 'menu'** key value pair, which indicates the menu response.

So when the user accesses your **todo** app, by sending **#todo**, ONEm will send a GET request to the **callback_url** as mentioned in [here](/bird-eye/). Your url should return something like the above json structure.

The response back to the user will be an SMS which will look like:

```
#TODO HOME
A New todo
B Done(0)
Todo(1)
C buy coffee 2019-07-01
--Reply A-C
```


## Type
The response **type** should be equal to **menu** to indicate a menu response.


## Header
The header of the menu is indicated through **header** key. This value is not final and will be altered by the ONEm platform, by making it uppercased and placing the name of your app in front of it.


## Body
The body of the menu is indicated through **body** key and it is a sequence of dictionaries. Each dictionary can be an **option** or a **content** item and this is set through the **type** key. A **content** type item does not need a **path** nor a **method** since these are not selectable by the user. However an **option** item needs a callback **path** and this is relative to the **callback_url** set in the app schema in the developer portal. If the **method** is not present, it will default to GET.


**NOTE:**

A body composed of only **content** items could be used for display purposes only. This is called a [raw](/building/raw/) response.

## Footer
The footer of the menu is indicated through **footer** key and like the header of the menu, it is not final and will be altered by the ONEm platform. If no footer is specified, a default is set like in the above example.
