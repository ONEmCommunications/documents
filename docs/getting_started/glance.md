New to ONEm apps? Alright, you came to the right place. Here is what you need to know:

- First you need to have a webserver able to return specific json http responses, like [menus](/building/menu/) and [forms](/building/form/).
- Then you will need to [register](/building/register/) your app on ONEm developer portal. Sign-up [here]({{ links.portal }}) for a free developer account.

Once you have done the above, you can access your application on the ONEm platform. **link to what are ONEm apps**
