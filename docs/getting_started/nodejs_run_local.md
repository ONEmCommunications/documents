This tutorial assumes you've already completed the steps in the [prerequisites](/getting_started/nodejs_prereq) section.

## Run an existing application

### Download source code

```bash
git clone {{ links.todo_app.github_nodejs_url }}
```

### Install dependencies

We first need to go to the project directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd nodejs-onem-todo
npm install
```

Your directory should look like:

```bash
$ ls
api     config.js     package.json       README.md
app.js  node_modules  package-lock.json  static
```

### Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

The above command will run the server locally at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

!!! Info
    If you try to access that link you will get a `403` error forbidden response, which is totally fine, since the server is looking into the HTTP headers for specific information sent by ONEm platform.

### Expose the server publicly

Since our server is now running on your local interface, ONEm platform cannot reach it. But we can work around this by using `ngrok`.

Open a new terminal, go to the folder where your ngrok is and start it up on `localhost` port `8000`. 

```bash
./ngrok http 8000
```

The above command will start ngrok tool, which is basically creating a VPN tunnel so our webserver can be publicly reachable.

The output should be something like:

<pre>
Session Status                online
Session Expires               7 hours, 59 minutes
Update                        update available (version 2.3.34, Ctrl-U to update)
Version                       2.3.30
Region                        United States (us)
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    http://5d283db8.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
Forwarding                    https://5d283db8.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
</pre>

!!! important
    The last line says that a public URL (https://5d283db8.ngrok.io) has been generated for you, which forwards all the received requests to your computer's server (http://localhost:8000).

!!! task
    Copy the generated URL from your console as we will need it in the next step.

### Register the application

To register your application open [ONEm Developer Portal]({{ links.portal }}) and register for a free account.

Once that is done, you will have an option to create an app. Hit that button and place the URL generated by `ngrok` as the callback URL.

!!! success
    That is it. We can now access the application by placing a hashtag in front of the name.

### Run it

In the developer portal there is a `Test Client` section. This is a phone simulator from where you can test the app.

Head on to the test client and send `#name-of-your-app`. At this point ONEm will request the callback URL we've set previously, so if you check the `ngrok` logs you will see the request there.

<pre>
HTTP Requests
-------------
GET /                          200 OK
</pre>

In the test client you can see the below response:

<pre>
#TODO MENU
A New todo
B Done(0)
Todo(0)
--Reply A-B
</pre>

!!! important
    The name of your app will be different, as chosen in the developer portal.

The above SMS response is rendered based on the HTTP JSON response returned by our `/` URL.

## Tweak the application
