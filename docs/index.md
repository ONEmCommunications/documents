ONEm's multi-channel micro-app framework offers developers with standard web building skills the ability to create, deploy and maintain a single code base data driven application that is accesible by users over many different channels.

With ONEm's single API, developers can use any web development framework or alternatively one of the popular Node.js or Python SDKs.

Just few basic HTML tags are all that are needed to present perfectly formated content on any channel, e.g. website, IOS/Android browser, social media and even SMS.

The ONEm platform handles the user authentication, data traffic and input validation between the user's channel and the micro-app application.

ONEm's multi-channel micro-app framework will save developers countless hours in development time and provide businesses with the greatest number of channel options.
