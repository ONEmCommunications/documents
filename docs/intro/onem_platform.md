# What is ONEm Platform

ONEm has created a global multi-service Platform that provides innovative services using core connectivity as SMS and Voice. We provide first of a kind interactive services and user generated content on the mobile. It’s not about replacing or even competing with the internet, it’s all about taking what already exists and putting it to a better use.
ONEm allows people to communicate in a completely new way through simple interaction with an intelligent platform that works on their behalf behind the scenes to connect, find, process and present communications, content and services across all types of networks and to any type of mobile device.
Whether accessed through SMS or a web browser, the ONEm Platform manages user's identities and profile, delivers intelligent content and allows users to collaborate and interact in an unconventional way.

## Mission and vision

We are building a Mobile Ecosystem first of a kind with interactive services, that will transform the way people communicate and get access to information on any mobile, including the 3 billion people who have no access to internet, who have no way to share nor create their own content. We aim to provide access to information and to make our services available to everyone.

## How services work

ONEm's goal is to have a service that is easy and intuitive to use. It is important for users to have a seamless experience when accessing the ONEm platform.
Different functionalities and content types are grouped in applications, also called services, accessible through the Platform, similar to websites via internet. Each service is defined by a unique name, similar to a web-address, and follows a general structure, allowing users to easily interact with the platform via text messages.
Similar to a website, the application will have a landing page and will provide a navigation structure using menus, selectable outlines, paging mechanism and the possibility to capture user input.

To access a certain application/service, users will use # before application name, eg #my_application. The Platform will automatically recognise the user input and will display the application's landing screen. Usability principles are implemented, so in case of an unrecognised user input, the Platform will respond with the best feedback or guideline.

To allow us to create an ecosystem, the users will be automatically registered when sending their first message to the platform. Their profile will be created and based on setup they will be able to access the available applications. Obviously, an opt out mechanism is in place.
