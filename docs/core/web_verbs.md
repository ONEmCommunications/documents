## Web widget verbs

[Verbs] are like shortcuts to specific areas of your app.  They are configured in the [ONEm Developer Portal]({{ links.portal }}).  Verbs are described in more detail in the [core elements section](/core/verbs).

In the web widget, users access your micro-app's verbs using the footer icon as shown here:

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img height="400px" src="/assets/verbs.gif" />
</div>
