# What is ONEm Framework?

The ONEm Framework provides a set of APIs and tools that allow you to rapidly build multi-channel micro-apps that solve a myriad of business problems.

ONEm Framework is a layer on top of ONEm's cloud-based platform that provides multi-channel solutions with a single code base.

## Goals

### Single Source for SMS and Web

### Web Standards-based

ONEm Framework is built on top of trusted, standardized web technologies: HTML, JSON, REST, using modern Web APIs such as our ONEm API. Because of this, ONEm applications build with ONEm have a stable base, are familiar to any developer and are easy to maintain.

### Simple yet Powerful

## Ecosystem

ONEm apps can be combined with ONEm's ecosystem.  Users of your app can acquire a global Id, we call it the ONEm name, that allows users in the ONEm global community to communicate safely with one another.
